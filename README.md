# STEP to STL converter

This simple graphical utility uses the [OpenCascade](https://dev.opencascade.org/) OCCT library to convert a STEP file into a triangulated STL file.

There are 3 presets for quality, from the coarsest setting which is suitable for FDM printing
(values taken from [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer)) to the finest which can be used with
artistic 3D software like Blender.
